Loan Amount, Credit History and other. This project has taken the data of previous customers of various banks to whom on a set of parameters loan were approved. 
So the machine learning model is trained on that record to get accurate results. Our main objective of this project is to predict the safety of loan. To predict 
loan safety, the Logistic regression, Decision trees, Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms are used. First the data is cleaned so as to avoid the missing values 
in the data set.
